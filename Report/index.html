  <h2>Investigation and Plan</h2>
  <p>I started my investigation by looking at many different board and card games. I used search engines such as DuckDuckGo and Google to find info on many board and card games. I looked at Snakes and Ladders, but the game is only luck based and there is no way for players to improve and get better at the game. I looked at Solitaire, Uno and Chess and these games would work for this project, but I think that they are too complicated for this project and take up too much time to program. I settled on doing Tic Tac Toe because it has the ability for players to get better at it and the game has a bit of probability to it too. I have looked at the rules and other digital versions of Tic Tac Toe and how they work (see references). I decided to not do graphics and have the game be rendered in the command line as I don't have the time to learn and make graphics for the game. My project will be written in Python as it is the programming language I know best, it will be rendered in the command line and it will be mostly written in a functional programming way to make the program as easy to code and modify as possible. My objectives are to make a working project that hits the below requirements:</p>
  <h3>Meeting Basic Requirements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tic Tac Toe is a game that isn’t too complicated, and I can model and create in python in a moderate amount of time</li>
    <li>Tic Tac Toe can have many inputs for the game itself and the game can start by taking name and email from the user as inputs</li>
    <li>Tic Tac Toe could be programmed for the player to be able to play the game on their own against the computer, have two players play against each other and I can program it to have two computers play against each other</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Meeting Advanced Requirements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>All of each player’s Tic Tac Toe moves and which player wins I will be able to record into a csv file</li>
    <li>The data generated from Tic Tac Toe is stored in a csv file and can be used for performing statistical analysis using algorithms to get info like the frequency, mode, mean and median of a player’s moves</li>
    <li>The above data can be used to prove or disprove a hypothesis like “If player 1 puts their first move in the middle of the board, they are more like to win”</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Design</h2>
  <p>First, I thought about all my requirements and how I will meet them. To take 3 inputs, I will have the program take three inputs: the user’s name, the user’s email and the game mode the user wants to play in. Next, I decided to make the main game in the program as a function with inputs that will decide which players are human or the computer. If a player is human, it will ask the user for an input to pick the player’s choice for the board. If the player is the computer, it will generate a random number between 1 and 9 as the player’s choice for the board. If the player's choice on the board is already occupied, a human player will be asked to input a choice for an empty spot on the board, and a computer player will generate a new number. The human player will kept being asking for a move until an empty space is chosen and the computer player will continue to generate random numbers until a number representing a empty space is generated. After each player move, the game will check the board against a list of winning game boards and it will also detet if the game turns out to be a tie. If it is a win or a tie, a message will be displayed saying if it is a tie or which player has won. If the game is over the user will be asked if they want to play again. If the user answers yes, then the main game function will be ran again with the same inputs and if the user answers no, the program will exit. When the game finishs it will record game data into a csv file including all moves of each player. I will then program a menu that allows you to pick what player's moves to use and what type of statistical analysis to do on those moves like getting the mean, mode, median, etc. The 3 inputs of email, name and game mode at the start, having the function to be able to run multiple game modes, recording csv data and using this csv data to do statistical analysis should reach my requirements.</p>
  <h3>Psuedocode and Flowchart</h3>

  <p>The abstraction of my program is where I didn't do graphics. This massively simplifies making the game as I don't have to learn graphic making and it keeps everything inside the command line.</p>
  <p>I used a function based model to make my program where pieces of code that would normally be repeated can be put inside a function and then that function can be called when needed. I have designed the functions to be adaptable using function inputs, so that one function can do multiple things.</p>
